# Copulas

Hi, this is the page I will be using to store any copula-related work, and I mean copulas in its statistical definition. You can find
some brief information about them in wikipedia, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)), or go for the standard
reference, Roger B. Nelsen's book An Introduction to Copulas (more about it [here](https://www.springer.com/la/book/9780387286594)).

Alternatively, there is a comprehensive presentation I would like to store here:

<a href="/files/copulas/Dependence Analysis via Copulas.pdf">Dependence Analysis via Copulas</a> - Nikolai Kolev, Leandro Ferreira and 
Rafael Aguilera

And below are other presentations for chapter 3, 4 and 5 from Nelsen's book, produced by my colleagues during a graduate course of copulas
I took at IME-USP in 2017.

<a href="/files/copulas/Copula Construction Methods.pdf">Chapter 3 - Copula Construction Methods</a> - Daniel Morales and Fernando CorrÃªa

<a href="/files/copulas/Archimedean Copulas.pdf">Chapter 4 - Archimedean Copulas</a> - Nicholas Eugenio and Yang Ting Ju

<a href="/files/copulas/Dependence Measures.pdf">Chapter 5 - Dependence Measures</a> - Daniel Reis and Nguyen Ngoc

Something else I have been working on is this app, which is an easy way to visualize how to fit copulas locally using local dependence
measures. You can find the app [here](https://danielmoralesx.shinyapps.io/local_copula_fit_app/), and its code 
<a href="/files/copulas/local_copula_fit_app.R" download>here</a>. Further information about it will be provided in a report I will leave 
here later.
