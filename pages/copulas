## Copulas

Hi, this is the page I will be using to store any copula-related work, and I mean copulas in its statistical definition. You can find
some brief information about them in wikipedia, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)), or go for the standard
reference, Roger B. Nelsen's book An Introduction to Copulas (more about it [here](https://www.springer.com/la/book/9780387286594)).

There is a comprehensive presentation I will leave here soon, with other presentations for chapter 3, 4 and 5 from Nelsen's book.
