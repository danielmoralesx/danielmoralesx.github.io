# Copulas

Hi, this is the page I will be using to store any copula-related work, and I mean copulas in its statistical definition. You can find
some brief information about them in wikipedia, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)), or go for the standard
reference, Roger B. Nelsen's book An Introduction to Copulas (more about it [here](https://www.springer.com/la/book/9780387286594)).

Alternatively, there is a comprehensive presentation I would like to store here:

<a href="/files/copulas/Dependence Analysis via Copulas.pdf">Kolev</a>

And below are other presentations for chapter 3, 4 and 5 from Nelsen's book, produced by my colleagues during a graduate course of copulas
I took at IME-USP in 2017.
