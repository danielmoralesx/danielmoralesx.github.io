# Integrate

Looking at the documentation from the `integrate` function from  R package `stats`, we see that the algorithm comes from QUADPACK routines, available at the book "Quadpack: a Subroutine Package for Automatic Integration", by Piessens, Doncker-Kapenga, Ãœberhuber and Kahaner, published by Springer in 1983. You can buy this book [here](https://www.springer.com/la/book/9783540125532), or search for it at libgen.

I coded a version of this function for Excel 2019 VBA, and the code is [here](). It is a numerical integrator for functions of one variable over a finite or infinite interval.
